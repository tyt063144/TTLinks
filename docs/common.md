1. Binary Management
* The `BinaryClass` offers robust management of binary strings, ensuring that the string contains only '0's and '1's through validation. It also supports conversion to lists of integers and provides string representations that are useful for debugging and display. Additionally, BinaryClass serves as a foundational layer in the `ipservice` and `macservice` modules, underpinning all IP and MAC address operations.
* Create BinaryClass
  ```python
  from ttlinks.common.base_utils import BinaryClass
  binary_class = BinaryClass('11111110')
  print(binary_class)
  print(binary_class.binary_digits())
  ```
  Expected Output:
  ```
  11111110
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  ```
2. Flyweight Pattern for Memory Optimization:
* The `BinaryFlyWeightFactory` and `BinaryFlyWeight` classes implement the Flyweight pattern to manage instances of `BinaryClass`. This pattern minimizes memory usage by sharing instances of `BinaryClass` with identical binary strings across the application.
* Memory-Efficient Management of Binary Strings:
  ```python
  from ttlinks.common.base_utils import BinaryFlyWeightFactory
  binary1 = BinaryFlyWeightFactory.get_binary_class("101010")
  binary2 = BinaryFlyWeightFactory.get_binary_class("101010")
  print(binary1 is binary2)  
  ```
  Expected Output:
  ```
  True  # since they share the same instance
  ```
3. Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
   * The `CoRHandler` abstract base class sets up the framework for building a chain of responsibility, allowing different handlers to process requests in a sequence. This pattern is extensively used for IP/MAC validation and conversion tasks, enabling modular and flexible processing.
